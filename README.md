Plugging into the Future: An Exploration of Electricity Consumption Patterns Using Tableau
📌 Project Overview

Plugging into the Future is a data visualization project developed using Tableau to analyze and understand electricity consumption patterns across different regions, time periods, and sectors. The project focuses on identifying usage trends such as peak demand hours, seasonal variations, and sector-wise electricity consumption. The insights gained can support better decision-making for utility providers, policymakers, and consumers to promote efficient and sustainable energy usage.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze electricity consumption trends across different time periods

Identify peak and off-peak usage hours

Understand seasonal variations in electricity demand

Compare electricity consumption across residential, commercial, and industrial sectors

Provide actionable insights through interactive visualizations

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
